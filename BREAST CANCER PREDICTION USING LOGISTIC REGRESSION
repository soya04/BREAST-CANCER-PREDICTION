# BREAST-CANCER-PREDICTION
Cancer prediction on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset using supervised learning - Logistic Regression. The model have achieved 100% of accuracy.

This project implements Logistic Regression to classify breast cancer as malignant [0] or benign [1] using the *Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset*. 

The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report shows high prediction accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of logistic regression for medical diagnosis tasks.
